# Data Manipulation in R workshop

An introduction to data manipulation in R via **dplyr** and **tidyr**.

This workshop is aimed at graduate students who have been introduced to R in statistics classes but havenâ€™t had any training on how to work with data in R. 

The workshop covers how to make data summaries by group, filter out rows, select specific columns, add new variables, change the format of datasets (i.e., reshape datasets), and join datasets together. Along the way students learn how to use the pipe operator to chain several data manipulation steps together. Students have time to practice data manipulation and reshaping using the babynames dataset from package **babynames**.
